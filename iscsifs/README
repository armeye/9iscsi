Usage: ip/iscsifs [-dD] [-m mountpoint] [-s srvname] host volume

Iscsifs is a iSCSI file server, that allows to manipulate all LUNs
in a specific target name. The directory structure is hereby:

	/n/iscsi/ctl
		    /$n/ctl
			/$n/raw
			/$n/raw

The root ctl shows on read the geometry and identifiers of all LUNs.
$n is a from 0 beginning LUN in the target. Every LUN has a file ctl,
that shows the geometry and identifier of that LUN, a raw file, that
can be used with scuzz and a data file, which provied rw access to
the blocks of the LUN in the target.

The ctl file in the root directory allows the command "reset", which
reconnects the iSCSI file server and reloads the LUNs.

Example of usage:

term% ip/iscsifs 192.168.0.23 iqn.2006-04.your.domain:somehdd
term% disk/fdisk -p /n/iscsi/0/data
part dos 7 31559
term% dossrv -f /n/iscsi/0/data:7 iscsihdd
dossrv: serving #s/iscsihdd
term% mount -c /srv/iscsihdd /n/d:
term% ls -l /n/d:
alrw-rw-rw- M 39 bill trog 180364 Oct  5 18:14 /n/d:/9LOAD
d-rwxrwxrwx M 39 bill trog      0 Nov 13 14:30 /n/d:/benedict

If there are several partitions, you can use fs(3) to manage them - it
seemed redundant to add partition handling to the umsfs driver itself.
